            <p><span class="bold-text">🙎🏻‍♀️ It all started </span>during the age of dial-up, when I opened a Xanga account and spent many hours designing and coding my tacky Xanga page. (*⌒∇⌒*)</p>
            <p><span class="bold-text">👩🏻‍🎓 In undergrad, </span>In my undergrad years, I changed my major from graphic design to biology in order to become a Physician's Assistant to help people. I found psychology and human anatomy fascinating!</p>
            <p><span class="bold-text">👩🏻‍💼 After graduation, </span>I became a caretaker for my family and found an opportunity at a debt collection account management company. As a caretaker, I loved brainstorming creative ways to help the patient become more independent. At the office, I loved working with my teammates to solve problems. When I had the chance to design event emails that made people smile, I knew I wanted to design experiences full-time! I joined a design bootcamp and haven't looked back!</p>
            <p><span class="bold-text">👩🏻‍💻 As a designer, </span>I am motivated by my passion to solve problems, work together and spark joy. I love understanding users at a deep level, which is why I love user research and interaction design. It's amazing to be able to use my background in science to prove or disprove hypotheses to come up with great design solutions! In this new career, I dream of working together to help change the world for the better.</p>
            <p><span class="bold-text">📚 In my free time, </span>you'll catch me reading, watching Netflix, listening to podcasts, exploring new coffee shops and restaurants, playing games or traveling.</p>
