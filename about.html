          <br><h2>My Story</h2><br><br>
          <p><span class="bold-text">👶🏻 Growing up, </span>I loved classic Disney movies and whimsical books. I started sketching Disney characters and animals, and my interest in art was born. Years later during the era of dial-up internet, I opened a Xanga account and spent many hours designing my Xanga page (R.I.P Xanga). I had so much fun learning coding and making my page as tacky as possible!</p>
        </div>
        <div class="section2">
          <p><span class="bold-text">👩🏻‍🎓 For my undergrad, </span> I majored in graphic design, but I was afraid of failure. I found a fascination in the human mind and body so I thought, why not become a doctor? That's safe. Goodbye studio, hello lab! Unfortunately along the way, someone dear to me became sick and I put my career on hold to become a caretaker. I learned that I hated seeing someone in pain and didn't think I could  cut it as a doctor. My friend informed me I'm too much of an empath, and she was so right.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="section3">
          <p><span class="bold-text">💲 Needing to work, </span>I found an opportunity at a debt collection management company. I soon realized that this industry wasn't right for me either because once again, it was sad. But during my time there, I learned so much about myself and finally figured out what I wanted. Being able to collaborate with my coworkers and solve problems were what motivated me. I enjoyed designing event emails and banners that made people smile and encouraged morale. And I learned I could do all this as a user experience designer! How perfect! I was ready to make a change.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="section4">
          <p><span class="bold-text">👩🏻‍💻 To jumpstart my design life, </span>I enrolled into an immersive design program where I learned visual design, interaction design, experience design and front-end development. I worked with senior-level designers on projects from the start of the design process to final prototypes or development. Now as a designer, I have learned to welcome failure as it helps me grow. When I was a caretaker and employee in the debt collection industry, I saw problems that I wished I could solve. I know now I can't do it alone. But by working together using human-centered design, I know we can solve these problems.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="section5">
          <p><span class="bold-text">🛩 In my spare time, </span>I love exploring new cafes, eats and breweries, reading novels or comics, listening to podcasts. Most of all, I love spending time with friends and family.</p>
