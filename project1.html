        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>I was tasked to create a cloud storage service that allows users to save online content, organize, create, upload, share and collaborate. A photo storage service was the most beneficial to build based on the findings from user research and competitor analysis.</p>
        <h3>Problem</h3>
        <p>Smartphones give everyone the tools to take stunning photos, but they have brought about concerns as well, such as depletion of storage space, loss of files, and security concerns. There are few photo storage services that offer a good balance of file sharing and security features.</p>
        <h3>Solution</h3>
        <p>The answer was to create fun service that helps the everyday photo taker to store, organize, collaborate, and share their media files while also offering controlled security and privacy. Our service needed to help users store their photos and videos securely to the cloud, and and make organizing, sharing and collaborating easy and enjoyable.</p>

        <a name="research"></a><h2>Research</h2>
        <h3>User Surveys</h3>
        <p>First, user data was needed to figure out what type of cloud storage services users use, why they are used, what is lacking, and other helpful info to determine what problem(s) needed to be solved. The following findings from the user survey were most notable:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>100% access service on browser</li>
          <li>79% use cloud storage for personal use</li>
          <li>54% dissatisfied with organization, security or privacy, or file sharing</li>
          <li>100% save documents, spreadsheets and photos</li>
        </ul>
        <img src="images/case study 1/research1.png">
        <img src="images/case study 1/research2.png">
        <p>These findings told us where the focus should be:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>organization </li>
          <li>privacy and security </li>
          <li>file sharing and collaboration</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Competitive Analysis</h3>
        <p>After performing a SWOT analysis on popular cloud storage services like Dropbox and Google Drive, it was clear the market was overflowing with file storage apps, but only a few photo storage apps. I saw an opportunity to create something for our users in this market. Upon analysis, Google Photos, Flickr, and Cluster have uses for certain audiences, but none of them solved the major problems identified in the survey for our target audience.</p>

        <h3>User Personas</h3>
        <p>In order to focus on the motivations, goals and frustrations of our potential users, I created personas to give them a voice.</p>

        <a name="ia"></a><h2>Information Architecture</h2>
        <h3>User Stories & Flows</h3>
        <p>For the MVP, I focused on the most important user tasks:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Creating an account or logging in</li>
          <li>Uploading an item</li>
          <li>Sharing an item </li>
          <li>Creating a folder </li>
          <li>Organizing items</li>
        </ul>
        <p>I sketched and created digital user flows that related to the high priority user tasks and a site map to frame the users’ navigation.</p>

        <h3>Wireframes</h3>
        <p>For the first part of the design phase, I sketched and digitally created low fidelity wireframes. Then I conducted usability testing to ensure easy readability and navigation. We only encountered out issues with consistency in the writing and the small search bar size. I made adjustments based on this feedback. In the Branding section, I will explain why the logo in the images show “Snaphero” but the prototype shows “Photostache”.</p>

        <a name="branding"></a><h2>Branding</h2>
        <p>The first draft of the brand name and logo sketches were for Snaphero, with the concept of the “snaps” being rescued by the product. However, the glyphs in the logo letters were too small when rendered digitally. The comic style that I wanted to display for the website design started to take too much time also.</p>
        <p>As a result, I created alternative logos (Squirrel and Photostache) and shifted the brand style to a rustic or hipster vibe. After all, I do live in hipster city. The concept was that users could stash their photos and videos using the service. Through preference testing, Photostache (#5 to be exact) won potential users over with its obvious meaning and punny humor.</p>
        <p>From there, I put together a moodboard and refered to that to create a brand style guide.</p>

        <img src="images/case study 1/photostachelogo.png" alt="photostache logo">
        <p>After more iterations and preference testing, the look of the logo also evolved to a more readible typeface. And now that the branding was done, I put together a moodboard and style guide that defines the brand's logo, typeface, icons and color palette.</p>

        <a name="mockups"></a><h2>Hi-Fi Mockups</h2>
        <p>I incorporated images and the brand styles into the wireframes to create high fidelity mockups. I used preference testing again to help determine the best design options.</p>
        <p>This time I conducted usability testing on the mockup prototype. There was one consistent issue that was raised by all participants. The more options icons needed labels for those who are not familiar with them. Being close to age 60, one of the participants couldn’t complete some of the tasks because she didn’t know what the icons meant.</p>
        <p>Finally, I added hovering labels to the icons and other changes, which lead us to the final iteration of the product.</p>

        <a name="conclusion"</a><h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>Looking back, I think perhaps too much time was spent pondering on design decisions when preference tests could’ve been utilized early on. Ultimately, this product was made for those potential users. I made many assumptions that were proven wrong through the usability tests. Encountering these problems early in the design phase is necessary and saves so much time and headaches down the line. I’m looking forward to be proven wrong again on future projects!</p>
